## Design Overview

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document `docs/diagrams` folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. EZSTATES utilises the existing architecture from
AB3 and adds its own features and components to facilitate client and listing management.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<!--[**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.]-->

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### UI layout

EZSTATES is built for users who prefer using their keyboard. Hence, all commands are accessible through CLI interactions.

When the app is first opened, the user is able to immediately see the `MainWindow`.
EZSTATES displays a default message in the `ResultDisplay` which helps new users navigate
the application.

**PICTURE**

For developers, there are 5 main UI components that are essential in understanding the design and implementation of
EZSTATES, which will be elaborated in the [UI Components](#ui-components) section.

### UI Components

EZSTATES contains 4 main UI components: 
1. MainWindow
    - [MainWindow Design](#mainwindow-design)
    - [MainWindow Implementation](#mainwindow-implementation)
2. HelpWindow 
    - [HelpWindow Design](#helpwindow-design)
    - [HelpWindow Implementation](#helpwindow-implementation)
3. Chat Window

    - [MoreInfoWindow Implementation](#moreinfowindow-implementation)
5. Confirmation Dialog
    - [Confirmation Dialog Design](#moreinfowindow-design)
    - [Confirmation Dialog Implementation](#moreinfowindow-implementation)

#### MainWindow Design

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

`MainWindow` consists of five main components `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,`ListingListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`.

The `CommandBox` allows users to enter commands into the application.

The `ResultDisplay` displays the result from entering a command.

The `PersonListPanel` is a scrollable list of clients. This list is updated when a user executes a command that interacts
with his list of `clients` such as `buyer`, `seller`, `deleteclient` and `showclients`. 

The `ListingListPanel` is a scrollable list of listings. This list is updated when a user executes a command that interacts
with his list of `listings` such as `listing`, `deletelisting`, `deletelisting` and `showlistings`.

The `StatusBarFooter` is a pane which contains the `ChatWindow`.

#### MainWindow Implementation

These 5 components form the `MainWindow`: 
1. `CommandBox`: Command input box
2. `ResultDisplay`: Command results box
3. `PersonListPanel`: Person list pane
4. `ListingListPane`: Listing list pane
5. `StatusBarFooter`: Contains the `ChatWindow` button

All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` components utilise JavaFx to render the components. The layout of these components are defined in their
matching .fxml files in `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout for `CommandBox` is found in
`CommandBox.fxml`.

This section will go through some additional information about each component in the `MainWindow`.

1. Command Box
- The `CommandBox` is the main method by which the user interacts with EZSTATES.
- The user types inputs into the `CommandBox` and hits `ENTER` to give a command to EZSTATES.
- At any point in time, the user can press the `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys to navigate the history of past inputs. 

<div class="note" markdown="span"> 
:bulb: The history of past inputs is refreshed every single time EZSTATES is closed and re-opened. 
<br>
Additionally, the history preserves
all inputs given by the user, including duplicate and invalid inputs.
</div>

2. Result Display
- The `ResultDisplay` provides feedback to the user.
- The `ResultDisplay` is scrollable if the output message is too long.

3. PersonListPanel
- The `PersonListPanel` contains the `clients` stored in EZSTATES.
- The information of a relevant `client` is displayed using the `PersonCard` component
- The `PersonListPanel` is a view of `PersonCard` components.
- Commands such as `find` will filter the `PersonListPanel` to show certain `clients` based on a given predicate. Commands
such as `showclients` displays all possible `clients` in the `PersonListPanel`.
A newly added `client` is added to the bottom of the `PersonListPanel`.

> **PersonCard**
> - The `PersonCard` is the component that displays the essential information of a `client`.
> - `Client ID`
  >   - The `Client ID` specifies the `INDEX` value associated with the specific `client`, relative to the position of the `PersonCard` in the `PersonListPanel`.
>   - The user will utilize the `Client ID` as an argument to run certain commands, such as `deleteclient` and `editclient`.
> - `Client Name`
  >   - This box specifies the `name` of the `client`.
> - `Client Phone Number`
  >   - This box specifies the `phone` number of the `client`.
> - `Client Email`
  >   - This box specifies the `email` of the `client`.
> - `Client Appointment`
  >   - This box specifies the `Date` and `Time` of an `Appointment` with the relevant `client`.
> - `Client Tags`
  >   - The green ribbons in the box define a tag for the c


<div class="note" markdown="span"> 
Certain fields that the user can input in EZSTATES are allowed values that can exceed the UI's ability to fully
display them. This design choice can be seen in fields such as the `client name`.
<br>
IMAGE HERE LOLOLOL
<br>
Our team has accounted for this as we do not wish to enforce arbitrary limits on the user. To account for this, we have 
implemented proper UI/UX design to wrap the overflown text. Additionally, the `moreinfo` command allows users to view the 
fully expanded details of their client.
</div>    

4. ListingListPanel
- This component mirrors the design implementation of `PersonListPanel`.
- The `ListingListPanel` contains the `listings` stored in EZSTATES.
- The information of a relevant `listing` is displayed using the `ListingCard` component
- The `ListingListPanel` is a view of `ListingCard` components.
- Commands such as `showlistings` displays all possible `listings` in the `ListingsListPanel`.
- A newly added `listing` is added to the bottom of the `ListingListPanel`.
    
  
  > **ListingCard**
  > 
  >- The `ListingCard` is the component that displays the essential information of a `listing`.
  >- `Listing ID`
  >    - The `Listing ID` specifies the `INDEX` value associated to the specific `listing` relative to the position of
  >      the `ListingCard` in the `ListingListPanel`.
  >    - The user will utilise the `Listing ID` as an argument to run certain commands such as `deletelisting` and `editlisting`.
  >- `Listing Name`
  >    - This box specifies the `name` of the `listing`.
  >- `Listing Price`
  >    - This box specifies the `price` of the `listing`.
  >- `Listing Area`
  >    - This box specifies the `area` of the `listing`.
  >- `Listing Address`
  >    - This box specifies the `address` of the `listing`.
  >- `Listing Seller`
  >    - This box specifies the `seller` of the `listing`.
  >    - There can be only one `seller` for each `listing`.
  >    - Every `listing` must have one `seller`.
  >- `Listing Buyers`
  >    - This box specifies the `buyers` of the `listing`. 
  >    - There can be more than one `buyer` for each `listing`.
  >- `Listing Region`
  >    - This box specifies the `region` of the `listing`.

<div class="note" markdown="span"> 
The `Listing Region` color pattern follows the same colour scheme as the Mass Transportation System (MRT) in
Singapore. 
</div>       

5. Status Bar Footer
- This component is a visual element located at the bottom of the `MainWindow`
- The `StatusBarFooter` contains a button to access the `ChatWindow` via GUi means.

#### HelpWindow Design

The `HelpWindow` can be accessed by pressing the `F1` keyboard shortcut or by utilising the `help` command in the
`CommandBox`.

The window is split into two areas. One area is the link to the EZSTATES user guide. The other area displays a scrollable
view of the common commands in EZSTATES.

**IMAGE**

#### HelpWindow Implementation

The `HelpWindow` is a view that contains the User Guide Link and displays some Common Commands.

1. User Guide Link
- The text on the left of the buttons contains the relevant `HELP_MESSAGE` which is a link to the EZSTATES user guide.
- The first `Button` which writes `Copy URL` copies the URL of the link in the `HELP_MESSAGE` onto the user's clipboard.
- The second `Button` which writes `Open in Browser` opens the link in the `HELP_MESSAGE` in the user's default browser.

2. Common Commands
- This scrollable view below the User Guide Link describes the common commands of EZSTATES in a `TextArea`.

#### ChatWindow Design

The `ChatWindow` is a chatbot that can be opened by entering the `chatbot` command or by pressing the `Chat with us!` button
in the bottom right corner of the application.

Upon accessing this feature, a new window opens with 3 main components:`chatArea`, `userInput` and `Send`.

**IMAGE**

The `chatArea` displays the conversation between the user, identified by the header `You:` at the front of each sentence, and
the chatbot, identified by the `Assistant: ` at the front of each sentence.

The `userInput` is an input field where the user can enter a prompt to the chatbot. The prompt can be sent to the chatbot
either by pressing `ENTER` on the keyboard or by pressing the `Send` button.

The `Send` button sends the prompt written in the `userInput` to the chatbot. The button does not send empty inputs to the 
chatbot.

<div class="note" markdown="span"> 
To facilitate the target audience which prefers CLI-focused interactions, the user can interact with all functions of the 
chatbot using only keyboard inputs. This is achieved in two ways. 
<br>
Firstly, when the `ChatWindow` is opened, the user can immediately start typing in the `userInput` without having to
click on the `inputArea`. This works for subsequent prompts as well. 
<br>
Secondly, the chatbot can be closed by prompting the bot with a `bye` message.
</div>     

#### ChatWindow Implementation

1. `chatArea`
   - Utilises if-else logic and validity checks to determine what response the chatbot
   should reply to a certain prompt. The logic that is reponsible for the chatbot's response is `getResponse()`.
2. `getResponse()`
   - Method in `ChatWindow` that returns a response based on the user's input.
   - The method utilises regular expressions to identify specific keywords and actions within the 
   user's message.
   - For each command, the method provides a usage example and syntax as a response.
   - The full logic can be found [here]().
3. `userInput`
    - A `TextField` that sends the user prompt to the `getResponse()` method.
4. `Send`
    - A button to send the `userInput` through GUI means.

#### MoreInfoWindow Design

The `MoreInfoWindow` provides additional information to the user. The window can be accessed using the `moreinfo` command
and an appropriate `INDEX` argument. The window can be closed by entering the `ESC` button or by closing the window using 
the cursor.

When opened, this window shows the same fields in the `PersonCard` but in greater detail. This is achieved 
by displaying the fields with greater length to provide a complete overview of the `client` details
to the user.

**IMAGE** 

Additionally, there is a `clientRemarksLabel` and `remarkInput` which provides users with another field
to specify characteristics or information about their `client` which can be hidden from the `MainWindow` as this 
remark is only displayed within the `MoreInfoWindow`.

<div class="note" markdown="span"> 
The `clientRemarksLabel` allows a maximum of 400 characters to be entered. This was chosen due to the small space
allocated for the remarks, which is a trade-off made to display other relevant `client` information.
<br>
<br>
Additionally, the `clientRemarksLabel` is saved in EZSTATES when the application is closed and preserved when it is opened.
</div> 

#### MoreInfoWindow Implementation

`MoreInfoWindow` utilises the `MoreInfoController` class to handle the logic and UI rendering of the window.

`MoreInfoWindow` sets up a new `Stage` to display the client details in a separate window, loads the .FXML file and binds
it to the `MoreInfoController`. `MoreInfoWindow` then passes the `client` to the `MoreInfoController`.

`MoreInfoController` handles `client` fields, the `client` picture and the user's `remarkInput`.

#### ConfirmationDialog Design

The `ConfirmationDialog` is a window that opens when the user utilises the `deleteclient` command. 

This window requests the user to make a Yes/No decision to confirm the deletion of the `client`.

The window displays the `name` of the `client` and that the `client` has an active `listing`. A `client` has an active listing
if he/she is a `seller` of a `listing`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
A `client` without an active listing will not open a `ConfirmationDialog` window upon deletion.
</div>

This window is developed as a fail-safe for users to protect against deletions of `clients` that is a `seller` of a `listing`
since a `listing` cannot exist without its `seller`.

<div class="note" markdown="span"> 
To facilitate the target audience which prefers CLI-focused interactions, the `ConfirmationDialog` window can be interacted with fully
keyboard-only inputs. 
<br>
<br>
In the window, the user can navigate between the Yes/No buttons using the `LEFT ARROW <` and `RIGHT ARROW >` keys. To confirm their
decision, they can do so by pressing `ENTER`. Additionally, they can also exit the window by using the `ESC` key.
</div>

#### ConfirmationDialog Implementation

Similar to the `MoreInfoWindow` implementation, the `ConfirmationDialog` utilises the `ConfirmationDialogController` to handle the logic
and UI rendering of the window.

`ConfirmationDialog` sets up a new `Stage` to display the delete confirmation in a separate window, loads the .FXML file and binds
it to the `ConfirmationDialogController`. `Window` then passes the `client` to the `MoreInfoController`.

`MoreInfoController` handles the logic for which button has been pressed by the user and displays the `client` name in the window.

<div class="note" markdown="span"> 
Why is it beneficial to create a Controller class?
<br>
<br>
This approach keeps the code modular and organized through the **Separation of Concerns** design principle. 
<br>
<br>
The `Window` class handles the window setup and layout loading exclusively while the `Controller` class manages all
UI interactions and dynamically updates the UI utilising `set` methods. By dividing responsibilities between classes, this
simplifies code, improves maintainability and enhances reusability.
</div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("deleteclient 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `EzstatesParser` object which in turn 
creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteClientProfileCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteClientProfileCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `EzstatesParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddListingCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `ListingCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the EZSTATES data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Listing` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueListingList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration in this project is done through 4 means: 
1. Unit testing
2. Automated UI testing
3. Automated Github testing
4. Code coverage reports

<div class="note" markdown="span"> 
EZSTATES utilises **Github Actions** for the project's Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow, 
automating tasks such as testing, building and deployment with each code update on Github.
<br><br> 
Github Actions utilises `.yaml` configuration files and can be found in the `.github/workflows` folder.
<br><br>
Github Actions operate in this manner: 
1. Trigger: Github Actions workflows are triggered but events such as `push` and `pull_request`
2. Jobs and Runners: A workflow consists of one or more jobs, each containing a series of steps.
Each job runs on a Github-hosted runner (a virtual machine or environment) to perform the defined tasks.
3. Steps: Within each job, steps are defined to execute certain tasks, such as installing dependencies, running tests, or 
building the application.
4. Feedback: After a workflow completes, Github Actions provide feedback on the success or failure of each job.
Developers receive notifications for failed workflows, allowing them to quickly address issues before merging or deploying code.
5. Deployment: Once a workflow has succeeded, Github Actions can deploy the application, ensuring that only thoroughly tested
code reaches users.

By utilising Github Actions, EZSTATES maintains high code quality and reliability, facilitating efficient collaboration
and timely deployment of updates.
</div>

### Unit testing
Unit testing covers non-UI related components of EZSTATES, such as `model`, `storage`, `logic` and `utility` classes.

The dependencies used for Unit Testing is [JUnit 5]().

### Automated UI testing
Automated UI testing helps to simulate user interactions, ensuring that the UI is working as intended.

The dependencies used for automated UI testing is [JUnit 5]() and [TestFX]().

### Automated Github testing

Automated Github testing is trigged or every push and pull request made to the Github remote repository and is conducted
on all 3 major OSes: MacOS, Windows and Ubuntu. 

<span class="alert">
Automated UI testing is disabled for Ubunutu on the Github Testing workflow due to the inability to create a virtual testin
environment.
</span>

### Code coverage reports

Code coverage reports are provided to developers in two methods: JaCoCoTest reports and CodeCov reports.

JaCoCoTest reports are generated using `build.gradle` and CodeCov reports are generated on every Github Workflow.

Usage: 
1. JaCoCoTest reports
- Configuration: The JaCoCo plugin is configured in `build.gradle`.
- Running reports: To generate a JaCoCo report, run either of these commands in your terminal:
<br>
    ```.gradlew/ jacocoTestReport``` to run all unit tests and automated UI tests
    <br>**OR**<br>
    ```.graldew/ build ``` which runs all tests, incuding unit tests, autoamted UI tests and checkstyle tests.
- Usage: JaCoCo reports offer a local overview of which classes and methods are covered. Developers are encouraged to review these reports after each
set of tests, especially before merging any significant changes. The HTML report highlights area needing additional tests.

2. CodeCov reports
- Configuration: To configure CodeCov, a `.yaml` workflow file is set up within the `.github/workflows` directory of the repository.

<div class="note" markdown="span"> 
A CodeCov token is required to set up CodeCov reports on Github and it should be stored as a Github Secret
for authentication. 
</div>

- Running reports: CodeCov reports are automatically generated and uploaded with each push or pull_request event as configured in the GitHub Actions workflow. 
After each run, the workflow will produce a detailed reporton CodeCov, accessible through links provided in the Github pull request page.
- Usage: CodeCov reports provide information on whether coverage has improved or decreased and highlight specific lines or files affected by new or modified code.
Additionally, CodeCov offers visualization tools for in-depth inspection of coverage across functions and classes, allowing developers to target untested areas in their testing efforts.

## Features and Implementation

### Client Management

![PersonClassDiagram](images/dg/PersonClassDiagram.png)

All clients are `Person` objects in EZSTATES. A `Person` is an abstract class which consists of 6 essential fields and 1
essential abstract method `getRole()`.

**Role**
- The `Role` class specifies what responsibilites a client has.
- The class is designed using Enumerations.
- As of v1.5.2, EZSTATES supports 2 `Roles`: `BUYER` and `SELLER`.

**Essential Fields**: 
1. `name`: The name of a Person, defined by the `Name` class.
2. `phone`: The phone number of a Person, defined by the `Phone` class.
3. `email`: The email address of a Person, defined by the `Email` class.
4. `appointment`: An expected appointment the user has with a Person, defined by the `Appointment` class.
5. `tags`: A collection of short comments or descriptions of a Person, defined by a set of `Tags`.
6. `remark`: A string which represents an additional remark about a Person. This field is used in the `MoreInfo` feature.

**Essential Methods**:
1. `getRole()`: Classes that represent clients must inherit the abstract `Person` class and are required to implement the `getRole()` method. 
This ensures that all clients have a specified `role`. `Roles` help developers differentiate various tasks and associations
with features such as `listings` and `getRole()` is a basic getter to facilitate this logic.

#### Add client

As mentioned in the [`Logic`](#logic-component) segment, a command is passed to the `LogicManager` and then parsed in the
`EzstatesParser` where the relevant `XYZCommandParser` is created and subsequently the `XYZCommand` is created. To facilitate
the usage of `roles`, a centralized `AddClientProfileParser` and `AddClientProfileCommand` is used when a client with any role is being
created.

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
